# Machine Learning Models

**This repository contains implementations of some machine learning algorithms from scratch on real world data, which I wrote while learning the same. Each algorithm includes the code file and the data on which it was applied along with various metrics to evaluate the model.**

## List of algorithms included in the repository:

* Bayesian Classifier
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* Principal Component Analysis
* Hidden Markov Model
* k-Nearest Neighbours
* k-Means Clustering
* Logistic Regression
* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Hierarchical Clustering
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Fisher's Linear Discriminant
* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding
